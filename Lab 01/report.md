# Lab 01 Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to use Git. 
I practiced creating new files, add it to the local through (git add) and saving changes with git commit. 
I also learned how Git tracks file deletions and how to push changes to a remote repository. 
Working with branches helped me understand how different versions of a project can be managed safely. 
Overall, this lab improved my understanding of how Git manages project history and collaboration.
